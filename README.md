# CNN-GH
Python codes for CNN
Python codes for CNN Deep Learning Project Idea â€“ This tutorial demonstrates training a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR images. Because this tutorial uses the Keras Sequential API, creating and training our model will take just a few lines of code. The idea of the project is to build an image classification model that will be able to identify what class the input image belongs to. Image classification is used in many applications and it is a great project to start deep learning.
