Deep Learning Project Idea â€“ The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of images of 10 different classes like cars, birds, dogs, horses, ships, trucks, etc. The idea of the project is to build an image classification model that will be able to identify what class the input image belongs to. Image classification is used in many applications and it is a great project to start deep learning.
